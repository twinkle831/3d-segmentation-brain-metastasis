# 3d-segmentation-brain-metastasis
Harnessing deep learning, this project tackles 3D semantic segmentation of brain metastases using BraTS 2024 and NYUMets datasets. With models like 3D U-Net, Attention U-Net, and 3D ResUNet, it delivers precise tumor identification, overcoming class imbalance through custom loss functions.
